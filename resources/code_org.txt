subdirectories

util
- definitions and functions that are application independent 
- no includes on other subidrectories

base 
- core definitions and functions specific to this application
- only include directory: util

i2c
- wraps I2C access
- only included directories:  util, base 

adl
- wraps ADL api for access to ADL devices
- only included directories: util, base 

ddc
- DDC functionality 
- only indluded directories: util, base, i2c, adl

test
- sample test code
- included directories: util, base, i2c, adl, ddc 

main 
- top level modules
- included directories: any


As with most real applications, 80% of the code is bookeeping. 
Key components: 

i2c/i2c_base: open, close, interrogate /dev/i2c devices
i2c/i2c_io: read and write to /dev/i2c devices, using multiple methods

adl/adl_intf:  wraps the ADL device driver API

ddc/packet_io:  read and write DDC packets 
base/ddc_packets:  understands the structure of DDC packets
ddc/ddc_vcp: sets and gets VCP feature values 
ddc/vcp_feature_record:  understands DDC VCP feature packets
ddc/ddc_capabilities: read device capabilities, which requires multiple exchanges
