# Changelog

## [1.1.0] 2021-04-04

For details, see [ddcutil Release Notes](https://www.ddcutil.com/release_notes).

### Added
- Configuration file **ddcutilrc**, located on the XDG config path.   
- Cache monitor capabilities strings to improve performance of the **capabilities** command.  
  Controlled by options ***--enable-capabilities-cache***, ***--disable-capabilities-cache***.
- Workarounds for problems in DRM video drivers (e.g. i915, ARM) when displays are connected to 
  a docking station. The same monitor can appear as two different /dev/i2c devices,
  but only one supports DDC/CI.  If possible these are reported as a "Phantom Display" instead 
  of as "Invalid Display". Also, try to work around problems reading the EDID on these 
  monitors, which  can cause the monitor to not be detected.
- Option ***--edid-read-size 128*** or ***--edid-read-size 256*** forces **ddcutil** to request
  that number of bytes when reading the EDID, which can occasionally cause the EDID 
  the EDID to be read successfully. 
- Issue warning at startup if driver i2c-dev is neither loaded nor built into the kernel.

### Changed
- By default, files generated by **dumpvcp** are saved in the XDG_DATA_HOME directory.
- **environment --verbose** has more detailed reporting of relevant sections of /sys.
- Additional information on **detect --verbose**.
- Additional functions are traceable using option ***--trcfunc***

### Fixed
- Regard IO operations setting errno EBUSY as recoverable, suggest use of option 
  ***--force-slave-address***.  (EBUSY can occur when ddcontrol's ddcci driver 
  is loaded.)
- Fix build failure when configure option ***--disable-usb*** is combined with 
  ***--enable-envcmds***.
- On AMD Navi2 variants, e.g. RX 6000 series, **ddcutil** display detection put
 the GPU into an inconsistent state when probing a SMU I2C bus expolsed by the GPU. 
 This change ensures that **ddcutil** does not attempt to probe such buses.
