ddctool
=======

ddctool is a program for querying and changing monitor settings, such as 
brightness and color levels.   

ddctool uses DDC/CI to communicate with monitors implementing MCCS 
(Monitor Control Command Set) over I2C.  Normally, the video driver for the
monitor exposes the I2C channel as devices named /dev/i2c-n.  

A particular use case for ddctool is as part of profile management. Monitor
calibration is relative to the monitor color settings currently in effect, 
e.g. red gain.  ddctool allows color related settings to be saved at the time 
a monitor is calibrated, and then restored when the calibration is applied.

## Feedback Needed

This is a preliminary release, and feedback would be very helpful.   
There are a lot of "moving parts that can vary from system to system: 

- The build environment can vary. 
- I2C implementation can vary with card, monitor, and driver.  
  There is variation in MCCS interpretation.  
- I2C is an inherently unreliable protocol, requiring retry management.  

In particular: 

- Were you able to build ddctool?  
  What changes were required to the Autoconf files?   
- Does it work with given card, driver, and monitor?  I'm not particularly 
  concerned with older monitors whose MCCS version is unspecified (i.e. is 
  less than 2.0).  On the other hand, I'm very interested in how ddctool
  handles monitors implementing MCCS V3.0, as the V3.0 specific code has not 
  been tested. In particular, does ddctool properly read Table type features? 
- And of course, is the program useful?   Does it merit further development?  
  What features does it need?

Command `ddctool interrogate` collects maximal information about the 
installation environment, video card and driver, and monitor capabilities.   
I'd appreciate it if you could redirect its output to a file and send the file
to me. This will help diagnose problems and identify features that should be 
implemented.

## Background

Monitor settings are referred to as Virtual Control Panel (VCP) features.
Features are numbered from 0..255, and are specified using the hex
representation, e.g. 1A for blue level.   

MCCS designates features as being one of three types:

- Continuous (C): Able to take any value up to some maximum
- Non-continuous (NC): Able to take only a designated set of values
- Table (T): Used for "raw" data such as a video LUT

This clean distinction has broken down as the MCCS specification has 
evolved.   Some features have changed category.  ddctool distinguishes
between "simple" NC fields for which there is a simple list of possible values,
and "complex" NC fields, where an algorithm must be applied to 
interpret the bytes of a feature query.  This is a ddctool distinction and 
not part of the MCCS specification.

Most features are both readable and writable (RW).  Some, such as 
VCP Version (DF), are read-only (RO), while others, such as Restore
Factory Defaults (02) are write-only.

There is an extensive set of options for tailoring ddctool operation. 
Some are described in this readme.   For a full list, use the --help option or 
see the man page:
~~~
ddctool --help
man 1 ddctool
~~~

### Monitor Selection

If more than one monitor is attached, the desired monitor can be specified 
using any of the following options:
~~~
--display <display number>
--bus <i2c bus number>
--adl <iAdapterNumber>.<iDisplayNumber>
--edid <256 character hex string>
--model <model name> and --sn <serial number>
~~~

Notes:

- Monitors under control of AMD's proprietary driver (fglrx) are selected by
  adapter number and display number. These numbers are specified on the --adl 
  option separated by a period, e.g. "--adlno 1.0"
- If model and serial number are used to identify the monitor, both options 
  must be specified.

To see a list of all attached monitors and their associated identifiers:
~~~
ddctool detect

### Instrumentation and Tuning

I2C is an inherently unreliable protocol, requiring retry management.  90% of
its elapsed time is spent in timeouts mandated by the DDC specification.    
ddctool has extensive facilities for reporting protocol errors, retry counts, 
and peformance statistics, and some ability to tweak execution parameters from
the command line.

The relevant options are:

| Option             | Function
|--------------------| ------------------------------|
| --stats            | report execution statistics   |
| --ddc              | report DDC protocol errors    |
|--maxtries()        | sets maximum tries            | 


There are 3 kinds of exchanges in which retry is possible: 

- write-only exchange.  Bytes are written with no subsequent read.  
  Used only to set a VCP feature value.  
- write-read exchange.  A write to the monitor, followed by a read.  
  Most DDC protocol exchanges are of this form.
- multi-part exchange.  This is a "meta" exchange, consisting multiple 
  write-read exchanges. Used to query monitor capabilities, and for 
  querying and setting Table type VCP features. 

By default, the maximum number of tries for each exchange is:

- write-only exchange:    4
- write-read exchange:   10
- multi-part exchange:    8

Option --maxtries allows you to play with the maximum try count.  Its argument
onsists of 3 comma-separated values.  The following example sets the maximum 
try counts to 3 for write-only exchanges, 6 for write-read exchanges, and 9 
for multi-part exchanges.
~~~
--maxtries(3,6,9) 
~~~
A blank value leaves the corresponding try count unchanged.   The following 
example changes only the maximum write-read try count:
~~~
--maxtries(,7,) 
~~~
The maximum maximum value is 15.

## Building and Running ddctool

Because of the variation among distributions, only general guidelines can be 
given for some ddctool prerequisites.

### Packages

ddctool requires the following packages for both building and execution:

- i2c-tools
- glib-2.0  (Problem: glib-2.0 can be packaged with different names.)

At least on Ubuntu, the i2c.h header file is found in a separate package.   
If the following package exists, it is required to build ddctool.

- libi2c-dev 

### Notes on building from git

Notes on building from git:

- If you see a message "required file './ltmain.sh.' not found", run \fIlibtoolize\fP
  (See https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Error-required-file-ltmain_002esh-not-found.html)
- Execute file \fIautogen.sh\fP.   
- (need notes on warnings that can be ignored) 

- May get the following warning when running automake
src/Makefile.am:38: warning: compiling 'cmdline/cmd_parser_aux.c' in subdir requires 'AM_PROG_CC_C_O' in 'configure.ac'

This is an autotools versioning issue.  It appears that this warning can be ignored.

### /dev/i2c permissions

Except when using AMD's proprietary driver (see below) ddctool requires 
write access to /dev/i2c-*.  

Some versions of i2c-tools create group i2c, and make that the group for 
/dev/i2c-* devices. In that case all that is necessary is to add your user
name to group i2c: 
~~~
  sudo usermod your-user-name -G i2c
~~~
For testing, it may be simpler to give everyone permission to write to 
/dev/i2c-* for the current boot:
~~~
  sudo chmod a+rw /dev/i2c-*
~~~
If needed, a udev rule for giving group i2c rw permission on the /i2c-dev-* devices 
can be found in distribution file resources/etc/udev/rules.d/45-i2c-tools.rules.   
You can copy this file to /etc/udev/rules.c. 

The following section from the udev documentation 
(<https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev/udev.html>) 
may be helpful:

> The udev rules are read from the files located in the system rules directory 
> /usr/lib/udev/rules.d, the volatile runtime directory /run/udev/rules.d and 
> the local administration directory /etc/udev/rules.d. All rules files are 
> collectively sorted and processed in lexical order, regardless of the directories 
> in which they live. However, files with identical file names replace each other. 
> Files in /etc have the highest priority, files in /run take precedence over files 
> with the same name in /lib. This can be used to override a system-supplied rules 
> file with a local file if needed; a symlink in /etc with the same name as a rules 
> file in /lib, pointing to /dev/null, disables the rules file entirely.

### Kernel Modules

If using an open source driver, kernel module i2c-dev must be loaded.  
Add the line "i2c_dev" to /etc/modules or a file containing the single line:
~~~
i2c_dev
~~~
to directory /etc/modules-load.d

(TODO: Do instructions need to take into account SysV init vs systemd?)

From the freedesktop.org systemd doc: 

>systemd-modules-load.service(8) reads files from the [following]directories
>which contain kernel modules to load during boot in a static list. 

>/etc/modules-load.d/*.conf
>/run/modules-load.d/*.conf
>/usr.lib.modules-load.d/*.conf

>Each configuration file is named in the style of /etc/modules-load.d/program.conf. 
> Note that it is usually a better idea to rely on the automatic module loading 
> by PCI IDs, USB IDs, DMI IDs or similar triggers encoded in the kernel modules 
> themselves instead of static configuration like this. In fact, most modern 
> kernel modules are prepared for automatic loading already.

### Building with ADL support

Special consideration is required if using AMD's proprietary driver (fglrx).
This driver does not expose /dev/i2c-* devices.  Instead, the driver provides
I2C communication with the montior through its API.

The license for the AMD Device Library (ADL) SDK library allows for 
incorporating its components in distributed executables.  The downloadable 
executable is (WILL BE) built with ADL support.   

However, the ADL license does not allow for redistribution of its files.  
If you build ddctool solely using the distributed source, it will not 
support monitors under the control of AMD's proprietary driver. 

To build a version of ddctool that supports fglrx connected monitors, 
do the following:

- Download the ADL sdk (currently at 
  http://developer.amd.com/tools-and-sdks/graphics-development/display-library-adl-sdk/ )
- Extract the following files (they will be found in various subdirectories).  
  Copy them to some directory on your system: 
~~~
 adl_defines.h
 adl_sdk.h
 adl_structures.h
 mccs.h
~~~
 
- When building ddctool, execute configure as follows
~~~
configure --with-adl-headlers=DIR
~~~
where DIR is the name of the directory where you saved the ADL header files.

### Special Nvidia driver settings

When using Nvidia's proprietary driver, I2C communication fails on some cards.
It worked on several older Nvidia cards I have, but failed with my newer 
GTX660Ti. (Specfically, I2C reads of 1 or 2 bytes succeeded, but reads of 3 
or more bytes failed.)  Others have reported similar problems. Adding the 
following to the "Device" section for the Nvidia driver resolved the problem:
~~~
 Option     "RegistryDwords"  "RMUseSwI2c=0x01; RMI2cSpeed=100"
~~~
 A file for making this change is 50-nvidia_i2c.conf located in distribution 
 directory resources/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d  
~~~
Section "Device"
   Driver "nvidia"
   Identifier "Dev0"
   Option     "RegistryDwords"  "RMUseSwI2c=0x01; RMI2cSpeed=100"
   # solves problem of i2c errors with nvidia driver
   # per https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/572292/-solved-does-gddccontrol-work-for-anyone-here-nvidia-i2c-monitor-display-ddc/#4309293
EndSection
~~~
Copy this file to /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d  

Note: This file works if there is no /etc/X11/xorg.conf file.  If you do have an 
xorg.conf file the Identifier field will likely require modification.

### Virtual Machines

ddctool can be built in a virtual machine.  However, loading i2_dev does 
not create /dev/i2c-* devices, either on VirtualBox or VMware.  It's not 
clear whether this is because of lack of underlying emulation or if it's 
a configuration issue.

### Installation Diagnostics

If ddctool is successfully built but execution fails, command `ddctool environment` 
probes the I2C environment and may provide clues as to the problem.

## Comparison with ddccontrol

The program ddccontrol appears to no longer be maintained.  It has a fragility 
reflecting the environment at the time it was written.  In particular:

- ddcctontrol, at least some of the time, uses its own I2C driver code.  
ddctool, on the other hand, relies exclusively on the the i2c-dev userspace 
interface to i2c. (And also, ADL for fglrx).   This should make it less fragile.
- ddccontrol uses a monitor attribute database to interpret VCP code.  
With MCCS 2.0 and greater, VCP feature code definitions are largely standardized.  
ddctool uses the MCCS specification to interpret VCP feature values.  It makes
no attempt to interpret values for feature codes designated as manufacturer 
specific (E0..FF). 

## To Do

This is a preliminary release.  There's an extensive TODO list

- installation without local build:
-- downloadable tarball
-- Ubuntu ppa, Fedora Copr, OpenSUSE build service
- cross-compile 32 bit executables on 64 bit systems
- write VCP Table type fields
- document the format of .VCP files (i.e. files read by `ddctool loadvcp`)
- UI
- package as library for use by other C programs, probably with gobject introsepection
-- Python API
