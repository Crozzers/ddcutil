/* From the Device Class Definition for Human Interface Devices:

Interpretation of Usage, Usage Minimum orUsage Maximum items vary as a
function of the item's bSize field. If the bSize field = 3 then the item is
interpreted as a 32 bit unsigned value where the high order 16 bits defines the
Usage Page  and the low order 16 bits defines the Usage ID. 32 bit usage items
that define both the Usage Page and Usage ID are often referred to as
"Extended" Usages.

If the bSize field = 1 or 2 then the Usage is interpreted as an unsigned value
that selects a Usage ID on the currently defined Usage Page. When the parser
encounters a main item it concatenates the last declared Usage Page with a
Usage to form a complete usage value. Extended usages can be used to
override the currently defined Usage Page for individual usages.
