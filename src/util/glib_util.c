/**
 * g_hash_table_get_keys_as_array:
 * @hash_table: a #GHashTable
 * @length: (out): the length of the returned array
 *
 * Retrieves every key inside @hash_table, as an array.
 *
 * The returned array is %NULL-terminated but may contain %NULL as a
 * key.  Use @length to determine the true length if it's possible that
 * %NULL was used as the value for a key.
 *
 * Note: in the common case of a string-keyed #GHashTable, the return
 * value of this function can be conveniently cast to (gchar **).
 *
 * You should always free the return result with g_free().  In the
 * above-mentioned case of a string-keyed hash table, it may be
 * appropriate to use g_strfreev() if you call g_hash_table_steal_all()
 * first to transfer ownership of the keys.
 *
 * Returns: (array length=length) (transfer container): a
 *   %NULL-terminated array containing each key from the table.
 *
 * Since: 2.40
